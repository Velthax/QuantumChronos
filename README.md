üåå Quantum Chronos: A Futuristic Daily Planner
Welcome to Quantum Chronos, where the discipline of time meets the vast potential of the cosmos. This application is a personal command center designed to help you master your daily schedule and achieve a state of focused, productive flow. The name "Quantum Chronos" reflects a core principle: just as quantum physics reveals a universe of possibilities, managing your time unlocks a world of potential in your own life.

The app's aesthetic and features are built around a central theme of disciplined focus and continuous learning, much like the great minds of science and philosophy you admire.
